            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),
            it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet.
            Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),[16] or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides.
            The Moon is classified as a planetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body, and lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g);
            Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

<!--Ordered list-->
<ol>
    <li><b style="font-size:20px">Gravitational field on Moon</b><p style="font-size:18px">The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.</p></li>
    <li><b style="font-size:20px">Eclipses</b><p style="font-size:18px">Eclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed "syzygy"). Solar eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide. </p></li>
    <li><b style="font-size:20px">Human impact</b><p style="font-size:18px">Beside the traces of human activity on the Moon, there have been some intended permanent installations like the Moon Museum art piece, Apollo 11 goodwill messages, six Lunar plaques, the Fallen Astronaut memorial, and other artifacts.</p></li>

                One particular challenge for astronauts' daily life during their stay on the surface is the lunar dust sticking to their suits and being carried into their quarters..<br>
            Subsequently, the dust was tasted and smelled by the astronauts, calling it the "Apollo aroma"<br>
                This contamination poses a danger since the fine lunar dust can cause health issues <br>
            In 2019 at least one plant seed sprouted in an experiment, carried along with other small life from Earth on the Chang'e 4 lander in its Lunar Micro Ecosystem
